;For exclusive use with LEDBlinky – Arcade LED Control Software.
;Maps MAME Outputs to specific controls or LED Controller ports.
;
;The following MAME outputs are most useful when used in conjunction with lighting LEDs:
;LED0, LED1, LAMP0, LAMP1, LAMP2, ... LAMPn
;The purpose of each output varies from game to game, but LED0 and LED1 can generally be assumed to flash the player start buttons when credits are available.
;Any MAME output state(value) of zero(0) is considered OFF and a MAME output state(value) of one(1) or greater is considered ON.
;Use the MAMEOutputTest application to determine which outputs are generated by each game. The MAMEOutputTest app will also display which controls (if any) are associated with each output per this file.
;
;To define outputs for a specific game, create an output group
;with the group name equal to the ROM.
;For example, [digdug]
;
;The [default] outputs will be used for any game which does not
;have its own named output group.
;
;Key=Value format:
;<MAMEOutput> = <ControlName>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,SingleIntensity>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,RedIntensity|LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,GreenIntensity|LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,BlueIntensity>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <pixelcade,PixelcadeCommand,PixelcadeParameter,PixelcadeMAMEOutputState,PixelcadeCommandTimer>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <webrequest,WebRequestURL,WebRequestMAMEOutputState,WebRequestTimer>
;
;LEDControllerType: LED Controller Name or Abbreviation. See the LEDBlinky Configuration Help Menu for a list of supported LED Controller names and abbreviations. Example: LEDWiz or LW, PACLED64 or PL, IPACUltimateIO or IP, PACDrive or PD, Howler or HO.
;LEDControllerID: This is the HardwareID value assigned to the LED Controller (LEDControllerType).
;Port: First Port = 1. Maximum Port varies based on the LED Controller (LEDControllerType).
;Intensity: 0-48, 129, 130, 131, 132 (values 129..132 only supported by LEDWiz)
;
;Pixelcade format must start with 'pixelcade' as first parameter.
;PixelcadeCommand: user, animation, text, console, arcade, clear, raw
;PixelcadeParameter: For 'user' PixelcadeParamter=<filename> from \Pixelcade\user folder.
;					 For 'animation' PixelcadeParamter=<filename> from \Pixelcade\animations folder. 				 
;					 For 'text' PixelcadeParameter=text to display. Text color and scrolling speed will be set to values from Pixelcade configuration in LEDBlinkyConfig (Integrations Tab).
;					 For 'console', 'arcade', and 'clear' PixelcadeParamter is not required. 'console' displays the current console/emulator. 'arcade' displays the current game/rom. 'clear' clears the display.
;					 For 'raw' PixelcadeParamter=<Pixelcade API command>. See pixelcade.org/api V1 REST API. Do not prefix raw command with 'http://localhost:8080'.
;PixelcadeMAMEOutputState (optional): 1 or 0. 1=on 0=off. LEDBlinky will send the Pixelcade command for the specified MAME output state. If not specified, command will be sent on 1(on) and clear on 0(off). See sampleROM example below.
;PixelcadeCommandTimer (optional): Timer value (specified in milliseconds) 
;					 Positive value; Throttle period during which Pixelcade commands will NOT be sent. This is useful for high frequency MAME outputs which may overload the Pixelcade display. After an output is received and a Pixelcade command is sent, all subsequent MAME outputs with Pixelcade commands will be ignored until the delay expires. The delay value should be slightly longer than the time it takes the Pixelcade to receive and process the command (display the image or animation).
;					 Negative value; Delay until Pixelcade command is executed. If the same MAME output is received before the timer expires, the timer will start over. This is useful for updating the Pixelcade display after the MAME output activity has completed, for example, returning to the game image. The delay value should be longer than the MAME output repeat frequency.
;
;WebRequest format must start with 'webrequest' as first parameter.
;WebRequestURL: WebRequest URL must be prefixed with 'http' or 'https' and will be executed as a GET request.
;WebRequestMAMEOutputState: 1 or 0. 1=on 0=off. LEDBlinky will send the WebRequest for the specified MAME output state.
;WebRequestTimer (optional): Timer value (specified in milliseconds) 
;					 Positive value; Throttle period during which WebRequests will NOT be sent. This is useful for high frequency MAME outputs which may overload the web server. After an output is received and a WebRequest is sent, all subsequent MAME outputs with WebRequests will be ignored until the delay expires.
;					 Negative value; Delay until WebRequest is executed. If the same MAME output is received before the timer expires, the timer will start over. This is useful for sending a WebRequest after the MAME output activity has completed. The delay value should be longer than the MAME output repeat frequency.
;
;Each MAME output can be repeated to assign more than one LED and/or Control and/or Pixelcade and/or WebRequest value.
;Spaces are allowed in the MAME Output (Key) and Pixelcade/WebRequest parameters (Value).
;Only three Pixelcade or WebRequest commands for each MAME output are supported (On, Off, and delayed). If more than three are specified, prior values will be overwritten.
;Pixelcade and WebRequest commands which specify a timer value are limited to two (2) timers (each), one for On/Off command and one for Delayed command. Any additional timer values specified will negate prior values. For example, if you have three Pixelcade commands with a timer value, only the second and third will be used.
;
;sampleROM example. 
;LED0 is assigned to player 1, button 1 and player 1 button 9.
;LED0 is also assigned to an RGB on PacLED64 ID 1, ports 28/29/30 and lights white (48/48/48).
;LED1 is not used.
;LAMP1 is assigned to an RGB on LEDWiz ID1, ports 1/2/3 and lights Red (48/0/0).
;LAMP2 is assigned to a single LED on LEDWiz ID2, port 2.
;LAMP3 Pixelcade will display the cool_image.png file (from the user folder) when LAMP3=1 and clear the display when LAMP3=0.
;LAMP4 Pixelcade will display "Power-up Ready" text when LAMP4=1 and clear the display when LAMP4=0 and a minimum of 2000ms (2 seconds) has expired since the text was displayed.
;LAMP5 Pixelcade will display the cool_ani.gif file (from the animation folder) when LAMP5=1 and return to the game image after 5000ms (5 seconds) of MAME output inactivity.
;LAMP6 WebRequest to turn on a home automation lighting scene will be sent when LAMP6=1 and off when LAMP6=0 and a minimum of 2000ms (2 seconds) has expired since the same request was last sent. Additionally, a WeRequest to turn off the home automation lighting scene will be sent after 5000ms (5 seconds) of MAME output inactivity.
