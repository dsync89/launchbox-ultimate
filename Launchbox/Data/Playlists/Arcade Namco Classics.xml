    <Notes>Namco Limited is a Japanese corporation best known as a video game developer and publisher. Following a merger with Bandai in September 2005, the two companies' game production assets were spun off into Bandai Namco Games on March 31, 2006, now known as Bandai Namco Entertainment. Namco was re-established to continue domestic operation of video arcades and amusement parks. Its headquarters are located in ÅŒta, Tokyo. The company's English name is often officially written as NAMCO (in all capital letters).

Namco was a front-runner during the golden age of arcade video games. Pac-Man went on to become the best-selling arcade game in history and an international popular culture icon. Namco was also known for creating successful franchises such as Galaxian, Ridge Racer, Ace Combat, Tekken, as well as the Soul and Tales series.</Notes>
