    <Notes>The Superboard II, also called Model 600, was quite the same board as the british clone Compukit UK-101.

It came in only ready built version and did not featured neither power regulation on board - User had to build or buy a 5V external power supply - nor RF modulator to display on a standard TV, but only a composite video output.

A 40 pin IC socket allowed an expansion board and OSI bus to be connected, giving access to memory expansion (up to 64 KB) and floppy drive controller.

See in the 'Read more' section a very interesting information about Mike Cheiky, the founder of OSI.</Notes>
